# Linear Programming in Python

The important files here are as follows:

* science_fair.py - the main file containing the python script 
* student_choices.csv - the input data file that is read in by science_fair.py 
* student_fair.xlsx - some users who have done linear programming in Excel before may find this file useful, as it sets up the same problem in Excel using the Solver module (although you will need OpenSolver to solve the problem since it has too many variables for the default solver)
